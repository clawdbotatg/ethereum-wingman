# Frontend QA Checklist — Three-Phase Browser Testing

A build is NOT done when the code compiles. A build is done when you've tested it like a real user in the browser. If you have browser access, a wallet, and funds — **use them.**

---

## Phase 1: Localhost + Local Chain + Burner Wallet

**Environment:** `yarn fork` + `yarn start` + SE2 burner wallet
**Cost of bugs:** Free

### Browser Test Protocol

```
1. Open http://localhost:3000 — take a snapshot, verify it loaded
2. Check page title in browser tab — is it correct, not "Scaffold-ETH 2"?
3. Click the faucet — fund the burner wallet
4. Navigate to every page/route — do they all render?
5. Click every button — does each one do something?
6. Do the full user flow start to finish:
   - Fill inputs → click action → verify state change
   - Check that data displays correctly after transactions
7. Test edge cases:
   - Zero amounts → proper validation?
   - Very large numbers → handled?
   - Empty inputs → error message?
8. Open browser console — any errors?
9. Verify events fire and UI updates in response
```

### Superpowers Available

```bash
# Impersonate any address
cast rpc anvil_impersonateAccount 0x...

# Fast-forward time (86400 = 1 day)
cast rpc evm_increaseTime 86400 && cast rpc evm_mine

# Infinite ETH via faucet (in header)

# Transfer whale tokens
cast send <TOKEN> "transfer(address,uint256)" <BURNER> <AMOUNT> --from <WHALE> --unlocked

# Snapshot and revert chain state
cast rpc evm_snapshot  # returns snapshot ID
cast rpc evm_revert <snapshot_id>
```

### Exit Gate
All items must pass before moving to Phase 2:
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Every page renders
- [ ] Every button works (no dead buttons)
- [ ] Full user flow end-to-end
- [ ] `forge test` passes
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] No console errors

## Phase 2: Localhost + Live L2 + MetaMask

**Environment:** `yarn start` + contract deployed on Base/L2 + MetaMask wallet
**Cost of bugs:** Real gas, real tokens

### What Changes from Phase 1

- MetaMask is in the loop (wallet connect, tx signing, popups)
- Transactions take 2-3 seconds (loaders are CRITICAL)
- Real RPC (rate limits, polling matters)
- Users can be on wrong network
- Tx failures cost real money

### Browser Test Protocol

```
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Connect MetaMask — verify wallet address shows correctly
3. WRONG NETWORK TEST:
   → Switch MetaMask to a wrong network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet)
   → Does "Switch to Base" (or target chain) button appear?
   → Click it — does it switch correctly?
4. APPROVE FLOW TEST (if app uses token approvals):
   → With insufficient allowance, does "Approve" button show?
   → Click Approve:
     - Does button disable immediately?
     - Does it show "Approving..." text?
     - Does MetaMask popup appear?
   → Sign the tx
   → Wait for confirmation:
     - Does the approve button stay disabled while pending?
     - When confirmed, does the action button ("Stake", "Deposit") appear?
   → Click action button — same checks (disable, loader, confirm)
5. DOUBLE-CLICK PREVENTION:
   → Click any onchain button — can you click it again immediately?
   → It MUST be disabled after first click
6. REJECT TEST:
   → Start a transaction, reject it in MetaMask
   → Does the button re-enable?
   → Does an error message show?
7. TX REVERT TEST:
   → Trigger a transaction that will revert (e.g., insufficient balance)
   → Does the UI show a meaningful error?
8. RPC HEALTH CHECK:
   → Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   → Watch for 3-5 seconds
   → Polling should be ~1 request every 3 seconds
   → If 15+ requests/second → something is wrong
   → Any 429 (rate limit) errors? → RPC config is bad
9. ADDRESS DISPLAY:
   → Find every place an address is shown
   → All should show ENS/blockies, not raw hex (0x1234...)
10. FULL USER FLOW:
    → Complete the entire app flow with real tokens/ETH
    → Verify final state is correct on-chain
```

### Exit Gate
All items must pass before moving to Phase 3:
- [ ] Wallet connects cleanly
- [ ] Wrong network detection + switch works
- [ ] Every onchain button has its OWN loading state
- [ ] Every onchain button disables on click (no double-click)
- [ ] Approve flow: network → approve → action (three buttons, one at a time)
- [ ] Allowance reads via hook (auto-updates)
- [ ] Reject in wallet → UI recovers
- [ ] Tx revert → error message shown
- [ ] RPC polling is sensible (~1 req/3sec)
- [ ] All addresses use `<Address/>`
- [ ] Real transaction end-to-end works
- [ ] No console errors

## Phase 3: Live Frontend + Live Chain + Browser Wallets

**Environment:** Vercel/IPFS + Base mainnet + any wallet
**Cost of bugs:** Highest — broken deploys, confused users, wasted builds, rate limits

### What Changes from Phase 2

- Frontend is public (anyone can see it)
- URL sharing matters (OG tags, Twitter cards)
- No more localhost (env vars, hardcoded values will bite)
- CDN/hosting rate limits (too many redeploys = trouble)

### Browser Test Protocol

```
1. Open the PRODUCTION URL (not localhost)
2. Verify page loads, title correct, favicon correct
3. Run all Phase 2 checks on the live URL
4. URL UNFURL TEST:
   → Copy the URL
   → Paste into Twitter/Telegram/Discord/Slack
   → Does an image preview show?
   → Is the title correct?
   → Is the description correct?
   → Is the image the right one (not SE2 default)?
5. INCOGNITO TEST:
   → Open production URL in incognito/private window
   → Does it work without cached state?
6. CONSOLE CHECK:
   → Open browser console on production URL
   → Any errors? Any warnings about missing env vars?
7. NO LOCALHOST ARTIFACTS:
   → Search page source for "localhost", "127.0.0.1", "31337"
   → None should be present
```

### Exit Gate
All items must pass before sharing publicly:
- [ ] All Phase 2 criteria pass on live URL
- [ ] OG image loads (correct image, title, description)
- [ ] Twitter card type is `summary_large_image`
- [ ] No localhost/testnet artifacts
- [ ] Works in incognito
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Favicon and page title are correct
- [ ] Footer links to actual repo
- [ ] README describes the project

## Automated QA Script

Run `tools/qa-check.sh` against any SE2 project to catch code-level issues:

```bash
./tools/qa-check.sh /path/to/project
```

Checks for: missing RPC overrides, bad OG meta, raw addresses, missing button loading states, default SE2 text, hardcoded localhost values.

**Use before Phase 3.** Catches syntax-level issues. Browser testing catches UX issues.

## The Golden Rule

| Phase | Cost of a bug | Fix time |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 — Local/Local | Free | Seconds |
| 2 — Local/Live chain | Gas money | Minutes |
| 3 — Production | Broken deploys, angry users | 10+ minutes |

**Every bug found in Phase 3 means Phase 1 or 2 testing failed.**
